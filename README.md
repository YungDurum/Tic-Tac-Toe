# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this project I created my first pygame project, and I implemented a smart-agent.
This project implements the game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a retro style.
Two modes can be played.
    One player mode:
        Against an AI trained by reinforcement learning (Q-Learning)
    Two player mode:
          Two humans against eachother
